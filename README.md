```javascript
const express = require('express');
const easyWaf = require('easy-waf');
const app = express();

app.use(easyWaf());

app.listen(3000);
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This software tries to defend many common attacks while keeping the rate of false positives low. There will always be methods to bypass this WAF. Therefore, using this package is not a reason to neglect security when developing an application.

## Features
- Restrict allowed HTTP methods and add your own ip black- and whitelist
- Blocks requests from bad bots
- Blocks malicious requests:
  - CRLF Injection
  - Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS)
  - Directory / Path Traversal
  - Open Redirect / Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (queryUrlWhitelist option must be set)
  - Prototype Pollution
  - SQL Injections and NoSQL Injections
- Can block requests from the Tor network (disabled by default)
- Compatible with many popular web frameworks and with the integrated Node.js HTTP server

## Installation
> ‚ö†Ô∏è I strongly recommend to activate the "dryMode" at the beginning to be able to identify possible false positives from the logs.
If EasyWaf should parse bodies, bind a body-parser middleware to your app before adding EasyWaf.

```bash
npm i easy-waf
```

In the [examples](examples/) folder you can find samples of how to integrate EasyWaf into your application.

If you run your Node.js app behind a reverse proxy, don't forget to set the `trustProxy` option.
To enable Open Redirect protection, configure the `queryUrlWhitelist` option.

## Configuration
EasyWaf is easy to use without the need for much configuration, but there are still many customization options.
```javascript
app.use(easyWaf({
    allowedHTTPMethods: ['GET', 'POST'],
    queryUrlWhitelist: ['github.com']
    modules: {
        directoryTraversal: {
            enabled: true,
            excludePaths: /^\/exclude$/i
        },
    }
}));
```
| Option             | Type     | Default | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| -----------------  | -------- | ------- |  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| allowedHTTPMethods | array    | undefined | List of all HTTP request methods that are allowed. All other request methods will be blocked. By default, all HTTP methods are allowed.    |
| customBlockedPage  | string   | undefined | Add HTML code to override the default "Request blocked" page. [View example with placeholders](examples/custom-blocked-page.js)            |
| queryUrlWhitelist | array    | undefined | List of urls that are allowed to be included in the path or query of the request url. By default, all urls are allowed. (Open Redirect / SSRF)  |
| disableLogging     | boolean  | false   | If true, nothing is logged. *This is not recommended!*                                                                                       |
| dryMode            | boolean  | false   | If true, suspicious requests are only logged and not blocked. In addition, the log format is changed to prevent an IPS from blocking the IP. |
| ipBlacklist        | array    | []   | All requests by ips on the blacklist are blocked. CIDR notation is supported (IPv4 and IPv6). On single addresses, a prefix of /32 or /128 is assumed. |
| ipWhitelist        | array    | []   | All requests by ips on the whitelist are never blocked. CIDR notation is supported.                                                             |
| modules[name].enabled      | boolean | true, except "Block Tor Exit Nodes"   | This option allows you to completely disable a specific module.                                         |
| modules[name].excludePaths | boolean | undefined   | Exclude paths from being checked by this module with a regex.                                                                     |
| trustProxy         | string / array | [] | If a reverse proxy is used, this setting must be configured. See [npm/proxy-addr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-addr) for possible values. |

## What is checked?

The following table shows which user input is checked by which module:

| Name                          | URL | Body* | Headers** | IP |
| ----------------------------- | --- | ----- | ------- | -- |
| Bad Bots                      | ‚ùå  | ‚ùå   | ‚úÖ     | ‚ùå |
| Block Tor Exit Nodes          | ‚ùå  | ‚ùå   | ‚ùå     | ‚úÖ |
| CRLF Injection                | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ   | ‚ùå     | ‚ùå |
| Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS)    | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ     | ‚ùå |
| Directory Traversal           | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ   | ‚ùå     | ‚ùå |
| NoSQL Injections              | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ     | ‚ùå |
| Open Redirect / SSRF          | ‚úÖ  | ‚ùå   | ‚ùå     | ‚ùå |

| SQL Injections                | ‚úÖ  | ‚úÖ   | ‚úÖ     | ‚ùå |

\* Bodies are only checked if req.body is set by a middleware or the web framework itself before EasyWAF.  
\** Includes user agent and cookies

## Contributing
Any contribution is greatly appreciated.

A few notes on PRs and code contributions:
- After cloning the repo run `npm i`
- Run `npm run precommit` before every commit: this runs ESLint and TypeScript (this should normally be done automatically by a git hook)
- If you add new modules or other features, create tests
- Before you create a PR, run `npm t` to run all tests
